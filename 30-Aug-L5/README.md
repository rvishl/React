## Component
- It is a reusable class/function which contains the JSX.
- JSX -> JavaScript + XML
- The HTML elements along with it's relevant JavaScript.
- DOM elements along with it's relevant logic and functionality. 
- One file can have multiple classes/function, therefore it can have multiple components.
- A component can return the JSX.
- It can be wrapped using ().
- In any case, return should start in the same line. Either the html tag should be next to the return keyword or the wrapper's ( is next to the return keyword in the same line.
- Components have to be exported. Commonly, we use default export because (1 file, 1 component, 1 default).
- Typically to maintain cleaner code structure. We create a directory called as components inside the src.
- Inside components we put all the various components that we will be using.
- The Component name should follow PascalCasing. Otherwise it will not work.


## Props
- This is short for properties.
- Props means sending of data from 1 component to another.
- Typically is Parent to child.
