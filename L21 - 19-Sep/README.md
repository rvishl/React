## API Data exchange.
- Getting data from backend.

## API
- A way using which two pieces of software can communicate.
- Medium of exchange of information.

## fetch
- This is a functionality which is used to get data any server.
- This functionality is NOT part of JavaScript. This is injected by the browser.
- window.fetch()
- fetch will return a promise because this can be a time consuming task and might not be executed immediately.
- The response is in a text format. However, the server can decide to send in a different format.
- JSON Format is used commonly. Sometimes, we might see XML as well (Second most popular format of information exchange).
- Because JSON is very commonly used, we have a helper function called json(). This function returns a promise. Once resolved, the promise result will contain the converted json data.
- If we don't want to use json, we extract the text from the response. To do that, we use the function text(). This also returns a promise, on resolving which we will get the text data. (Like raw data).


**Any Request or response is made up of 2 parts, a head and body, headers contains information like URL, status, authorization, cookies, cors, origin, etc, etc. Body contains the data. Body is also referred to as payload.**

### Client-Server Architecture
- Client (mostly browser) makes a request.
- Request is sent to the server.
- Server will process it.
- Server will send the response back to the client.

### Network Tab in Devloper Tools
- This tab stores information about all the network calls that my browser tab will make.
- If we click on any one of them, we can see more information about that particular network call.

- To explicitly convert string to JSON, we use JSON.parse().
- To explicitly convert JSON to string, we use JSON.stringify().

### Polling
- Making a request to the server every X number of seconds to fetch the latest data.
- Example, during cricket match, the app will make request to the server every 5, 10 seconds to get the latest score information.
- This is not an ideal, but it is VERY VERY easy to implement.
- Because of that, this is a very common practice.

## Callback Hell
- This is when we have nested callbacks.
- Having one callback inside another callback.
- This leads to a triangle like look which we can easily sense and connect with the callback hell.
- This is bad for code readability.
- Because of that, the maintanability is also a problem. If we cannot even read the code, how can fix a problem or add a feature.
- We want to avoid this.
- The simplest solution is to use a then chaining.

## Then chaining 
- Instead of putting callbacks of promises inside one another, we will return that promise.
- Because we return, we can use the .then() method at the parent level.
- We can keep on doing this multiple times, ending in the creation of a chain of .then methods.
- Promise.then().then().then().
- We can also write in new lines for each .then(). NOTE - DO NOT PUT SEMI-COLON after .then() if there is another .then() after it.
- Promises()
    .then()
    .then()
    .then()
    ```

- This is not an ideal approach, but still is better than the callback hell.

# Assingment:
- Create a simple page on Vanilla JS.
- Have a button, upon clicking of that button, it should load the data.
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- Show an unordered list containing `${f_name} ${l_name} (${email})`
