# ReactJS
- It is a frontend library. 
- frontend -> For the clients (web browers).
- library - A set of code written (classes and functions bundled together to make your work as a developer easy).
- React makes development faster (compared to usual vanilla development).
- ReactJS is the top most package that is being used.
- Because it is most popular, the developer community is big.
- That means, if a new person wants to learn react, many many many resources are there.  
- React is by Facebook. That means, it is backed up by a big company.
- Future is safe(React is going to stay). It is actively maintained.
- It is opensource - https://github.com/facebook/react
- React is super popular.

## Library VS Framework
- React (Liberary) vs Angular (Framework)
- Library is small in size.
- Framework is big in size.
- React is faster compared with Angular and other framework.
- In a framework, many things are built in.
- In a library, it only contains the basics.
    - Example: 
        - In React, API calls are not there, we import and axios. There is not routing by default, we need to use react-router.
        - In Angular, all these things are built-in.
- Libraries only contains the bare minimum that you need minimum that you need to get started. Anything extra, you need to install seprately.

## NodeJS
- NodeJS is a software used to run JS outside of the browser.
- React supports JSX. (JavaScript XML).
- Browsers don't support it.
- There is a package called as babel which acts as a transpiler (convertor).
- This converts the JSX into JS + HTML + CSS.
- This babel runs on nodeJS.

**NodeJS is not a requirement, there is a way using which we can create node applications without having NodeJS installed. That way is called CDN** 

**ReactJS and ReactNative are two DIFFERENT things. ReactJS is for websites whereas React Native is for Mobile Applications.**

## Getting Started with a react application.
- We ~need~ want node JS. (Download Version 16).
- https//:nodejs.org/en/
- After nodeJS  is installed, we create a new folder.
- Then we execute a command -> npx create-react-app demo.
# Directory Structure 
- The overview of directory structure created by the CRA command.
- <project_name>
    - node_modules - This is a directory which contains all the modules/packages that we are using. This is a really big directory, we never share it. These packages are important for better execution / development of the React Application.
    - public - This directory contains things that are to be shown to the public. 
        - favicon - This is the icon shown next to the title.
        - index.html - This is the main file.
        - logo - This is the logo file which we might use.
        - manifest.json -  More like a metadata for the website.
        - robots.txt - For SEO.
    - src - This contains the source code. Whatever we customize is going to be inside this. 
    - .gitignore - This is for git and github. Basically, it tells which files to ignore
    - package.json - This contains information about project as well as packages used the project.
    - package-lock.json - This is extended version of package.json
    - README.md - This is a markdown file, used for documentation For humans to read.

    ## Details of src directory









## Task: 
- Create a react application and in the HTML, create a basic about me page. No need of any fancy CSS for now. Just the html basic is okay.

- Create a React app and in the HTML of part of App.js, change it to like an intro for a restaurant website.
