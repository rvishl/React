## React fragments
### empty fragments - Why we use empty braces
- It can return only single things. So either it can be a div tag, span tag, paragrap or ancor tag anything. But it will say that i will return only one single thing, i will not return more than that

- What will happen if i return div 
    - when we return div it will occupied some space on my DOM tree. So, there is space consuption but if we use empty fragment over here there would be no unneccesarly space consuption its a simple logic why we use empty fragment instead of div.
