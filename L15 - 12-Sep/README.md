## useEffect
- This is a built in hook. Built into react. We need to import this in order to use it. This is a named export.
- This is a hook (function) which accepts  2 things.
    - Callback function.
    - Dependency array.
- If anything from that dependency array is changed, then it will call that callback function.
- Usage - If we want to execute some certain function if the state value changes.
- The state can be created state (using useState) or it can also be an imported state from another hook.
- This is used to implement side Effect.
- Side effect is the functionality that we implement which is not the CORE effect.

**Hooks were introduced in React 16.8**
